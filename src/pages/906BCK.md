# Routing!!!

- We already know basic routing in Express
- `app.<method>(<path>, <function>)`
- `app.get('/hi', (req, res) => res.send("Hello world!"));`

- AND We already know route variables in Express
- `app.get('/users/:username', (req,res) => res.send("Hi, " + req.params.username));`

- AND we know these functions are actually middleware functions
- BUT did you know, you can specify multiple (middleware) functions for a route at the same time? :O

```js
app.get('/users',
    (req,res,next) => { console.log("/users loading"); next(); },
    (req,res) => { res.send("Users here hello"); }
)
```
- The routing is even more flexible than that! Read more: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html

- You can even have an route with multiple HTTP methods (verbs) attached to it:

```js
app.route('/book')
    .get((req,res) => { res.send("Books LIST!"); })
    .post((req,res) => { res.send("Books CREATE!"); })
    .put((req,res) => { res.send("Books UPDATE!"); })
    .delete((req,res) => { res.send("Books REMOVE!"); });
```

- So routing is super flexible, many options!

# Introducing express.Router

- One super cool feature of Express routing is `express.Router`
- When you have a big app, you can divide parts of your app into separate pieces with the Router
    - Useful for APIs!

 # Handling Errors

- What do you mean `details` is wrong?

```js
// Global error handler; needs to be the last middleware!
app.use((err,req,res,next) => { 
    console.log(err);
    res.status(500);
    res.send({ message: err.message });
})
```

- OK; cool - what if we actually want to do something about the specific error in the handler function itself???
    - Answer: we can add a "try...catch" block locally tp where we think the error might happen
    - See the example app for details :)
