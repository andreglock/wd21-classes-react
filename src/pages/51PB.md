# PB - Data Structures - 3

Last time we did
    - Methods
    - Object scope / object context: `this`
    - the for...in loop

Today we will do
    - Yet Another For Loop!
    - Object helper methods

Later this week we will do
    - Clone vs Reference
    - Destructuring
    - Nesting
    - Advanced array methods


# Quiz

    WELL DONE EVERYONE!

# New things

Remember the `for...in` loop? That was used to loop over **object**.

Well, introducing... `for...of` loop for **arrays**.

# Object helper methods

- Returns an array of keys / property names for our object
- `Object.keys(<object>);`

- Returns an array of values / property values for our object
- `Object.values(<object>);`

- Returns an array of arrays (key-value pairs of the properties) for our object
- `Object.entries(<object>);`


# Remember researching

Learning how to research and find information is a vital skill.
You can research more of these on your own if you want or if you need!
    Google "javascript stop object modification"
