# PB - Data Structures - 6

Yesterday we did 
    Destructuring Arrays and Objects (and strings)
    Nesting Arrays and Objects

Today we will do
    Advanced Array Methods!

# QUIZ

# Advanced Array Methods

1. Looping through an array - a new method - \`forEach\`
2. Converting an array to a different array - \`map\`
3. Getting a subset of an array - \`filter\`
4. Converting / reducing an array to a single value - \`reduce\`

These things we have looked at are called "higher-order functions"

    "Functions that operate on other functions; either taking them as arguments or returning them"

Taking an other function as an argument is often referred to as a callback function. This is because the argument is "called back" by the higher-order function. This is a concept that JS uses a lot.
