part 1\n\n## Separation of concerns\n\n- It is a good idea to keep structure (HTML) and visuals (CSS) separate\n    - Separate people often work on these\n    - Better organization\n    - With external CSS; you only have to update one place\n    - It is also faster to load websites when the files are separate (cache; caching)\n    - It\'s clearer\n\n- ! CONTENT IS KING !\n    - With the exception of art websites, the content is what truly matters most\n    - Generally, it is better to have fantastic content than fantastic visuals\n    - However, visuals make the content better too!\n    - The structure of content is important for Search engines and humans\n    - HTML and CSS are *strongly* connected, and sometimes HTML needs to accommodate CSS\n\n- Semantics\n    - The art of using the right tag in the right place\n    - This can be difficult, depends on the situation\n    - Let us strive to do our best and select good elements!\n\n- This is where as a developer you develop your own skills with experience a lot!\n\n## HTML Continued\n- `title` HTML attribute, can be used in Many different tags (such as `p`)\n- `<br>` - Break row, mostly used inside paragraphs\n- `<hr>` - Horizontal rule, it draws a line! Useful for separating content\n- `<pre></pre>` - Preformatted text!\n    - By default, uses a Monospaced font\n    - Preserves whitespace\n    - Often used for text art for example\n- LISTS\n    - `<ul>` Unorganized list\n    - `<ol>` Organized list\n    - `<li>` List item\n    - Often nested within each other!\n- Often projects or companies have their own style guide\n    - For example https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html\n    - Personally, I just use my own judgement\n    - HTML style varies a bit from developer to developer\n    - Old project? Follow the style that is already there\n- Indentation and nice code is important\n- Especially when looking at the original source\n\n## CSS - "Cascading Style Sheets"\n- Three types\n    - External (link tag)\n    - Internal (style tag)\n    - Inline (style attribute)\n- Example: `p { color: red; }`\n    - Here `p` is a selector\n    - Here `{ color: red; }` is the declaration\n    - Here `color` is the property\n    - Here `red` is the value\n- CSS can be applied in multiple different ways at the same time\n    - (internal, external and inline)\n    - example: dw.com has all three in use at the same time\n- New thing: commenting out CSS code!\n    - Use this style: /* CSS here */\n    - VSCode shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + 7\n- Reminder: "Cascading"\n    - Styles cascade down from parent element to descendants\n    - For example, the Body can have a red color\n    - And then all of its descendents will also be red',M=t(2),L=t(3);function D(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(M,{remarkPlugins:[L],children:N})})}var N='\n# UIB content 2\n\n## New CSS Stuff!\n- Elements with an "id" attribute\n    - New HTML attribute called `id`\n    - One element can only have one ID\n    - *Unique*: One ID *SHOULD* only be used by one element in an HTML file\n    - Values are alphanumeric (alphabet and numbers)\n    - Avoid \xfc \xf6 \xe4 etc, keep them from a to z (american alphabet...)\n    - Generally, these tend to be in english\n    - It\'s good to keep them descriptive, even if they are a bit long\n    - Getting more rare, still used but not super much\n    - ID is more powerful than the class when it comes to CSS\n    - ID CSS overrules class CSS\n- Elements with "class"\n    - New HTML attribute called `class`\n    - You can have multiple elements in the same HTML file with the same class\n    - You can have multiple classes in the same HTML element (tag)\n        - Different classes for one element are separated with a space\n            - For example: `class="important hilight"`\n    - Values are alphanumeric (alphabet and numbers)\n    - Avoid \xfc \xf6 \xe4 etc, keep them from a to z (american alphabet)\n    - Generally, these tend to be in english\n    - It\'s good to keep them descriptive, even if they are a bit long\n    - Much more popular\n- CSS Selectors\n    - ID: `id="title"` --\x3e `#title`\n    - Class: `class="important"` --\x3e `.important`\n\n## New css selector type\n- "Descendent combinator" CSS selector\n- Looks like this: `ol li { color: blue; }`\n    - Here "li" is descended from "ol"\n\n## NEW CSS!\n- `font-weight` -- defines the font weight\n    - Values are usually "bold" or "normal", but can be "bolder" for example\n- `background-color` -- defines the background color\n    - Used like "color"\n- `list-style-type` -- defines how the "bullet points" of a LIST look like\n    - Values like `circle` and `square`\n    - Also values like `"- "` work too!\n        - Any text characters\n        - Emojis are normal text characters! (Unicode)\n        - \ud83d\ude3a\n\n## HTML - (hyper)links\n- Anchor element: `<a>`\n    - "a" is the element\n    - "<a>" is the tag\n- The target of a link is defined in an attribute called `href`\n    - `<a href="staff.html">Staff</a>`\n- Originally used just for jumping around inside one file, kind of like bookmarks inside a PDF\n    - Still can be used in this way by referencing IDs!\n    - `<a href="top">Click to go up</a>`\n- Now, more commonly they link between files\n    - `<a href="staff.html">Staff</a>`\n- Can be used to link between different websites! (External sites)\n    - `<a href="https://wwww.google.de/">Googl</a>`\n- Can also be used to trigger different kinds of functionality, like sending an email\n    - `<a href="mailto:joel.peltonen@gmail.com">Email Joel</a>`\n        - mailto is a protocol!\n        - the href here is a URI (Universal Resource Identifier)\n        - Not a URL\n    - Other protocols (many!) exist as well, such as "tel"\n\n\n\n## Color in CSS\n- Colors can be defined in many ways\n    - Named colors / keywords: pink, blue, purple, silver, palegoldenrod...\n    - Hex colors / Hexadecimal colors: #FF   00     00\n                                       255   00     00\n                                       RED   GREEN  BLUE\n    - rgb(255, 0, 0);\n- Transparency\n    - CSS property\n        - `opacity` -- "How opaque something is"\n        - Ranges from 1.00 to 0.00, for example "0.50"\n    - CSS color\n        - rgba - Red,   Green,  Blue,   Alpha\n                 0-255, 0-255,  0-255,  0-1\n- Other color schemes\n    - Self study\n    - CMYK\n    - HSL\n    - HSLA\n\n## Important! \n    In CSS it matters in what order your declarations are in\n\n## CSS Pseudo classes\n- link states are a great example of these!\n    - visited link\n        - CSS with pseudoclass: `a:visited { color: black; }`\n    - active link\n        - CSS with pseudoclass: `a:active { color: black; }`\n    - hovered link#\n        - CSS with pseudoclass: `a:hover { color: red; }`+\n- Try out link pseudoclass styles in different orders\n    - visited after active\n    - active after visited\n    - hover before either\n    - hover after either \n    - etc\n    - the order matters!\n',U=t(2),E=t(3);function R(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(U,{remarkPlugins:[E],children:F})})}var F='\n# UIB day 4\n\n## Updating a forked repository from the original\n - Automatic\n    - Create a new Pull Request in GitHub\n    - Click on "Switch base", if it is available to you#\n    - After merging the Pull Request, update your local repository using git pull\n - Manual\n    - Copy the changes manually\n    - use git commands (Search Google for assistance here)\n\n## CSS Units\n - CSS has a lot of units to use\n - We will be looking at "px", "%", "em", "rem", "vw", "vh"\n - New CSS: `width`, `height`, `font-size`\n - New HTML: `<div>`\n    - No semantic meaning\n    - Container element, wrapper\n    - Often deeply nested\n    - Very very common in the real world\n- Pixels or `px`\n    - Static length or static size\n    - Basically, these are the unit of the web\n    - Reference pixels, Not Device pixels\n        - Mobile phone with 4k\n        - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_pixel\n        - Affected by zoom!\n    - Values smaller than one pixel can exist and are fairly common\n        - For example `font-size: 15.2px;`\n- Percentages or `%`\n    - Dependant on the parent\n    - Dynamic length or dynamic size\n    - Affected by zoom levels\n    - You can be more accurate than 1%, so "50.04%" is valid\n- For most users, the default font size of a browser is "16px"\n    - The root font size of a page is defined by the `<html>` element\n    - You can define this yourself with CSS\n    - The font settings _cascade_ down from the `<html>` element\n- Font size with percentages\n    - Like widths, these are dependent on the parent!\n    - Gets complicated with nesting!\n\n- `em` and the `rem` units\n    - Typography units\n    - Often used in font sizing, very useful there\n    - Not common for defining layouts\n        - Except for a few exceptions\n    - Units that come from typesetting originally\n    - rem - "root em" units\n        - Relative to root font size\n        - Can be tricky to design around if you don\'t have a set root font size\n            - Users might have different default font sizes\n        - A size that is relevant to the ROOT font size\n        - Can be thought of as percentages relevant to the root font size\n            - `1.2rem` is 120% of the root font size\n            - `0.5rem` is 50% of the root font size\n            - `.5rem`  is 50% of the root font size\n            - `1.337rem` is 133.7% of the root font size\n        - Common for especially font sites\n        - Sometimes used for icon sizes as well\n    - em - "em" units\n        - Relative to parent font size\n        - If the parent font size is "20px"\n            - 0.1em == 2px (10% of 20px)\n            - 1em == 20px (100% of 20px)\n            - 2em == 40px (200% of 20px)\n        - Pretty much the same as percentages when it comes to font size\n            - 1em works exactly like 100% *for text*\n        - Originally from how wide the "M" character is for a font\n        - Now in CSS it is just the font size\n        - Good use case: Icon images inside text elements\n            - Relevant to the text size of the parent\n\n- `vw` -  `vh`\n    - percentages of the viewport height and width in pixels\n    - values from 0 to 100\n    - viewport width\n        - sizing relative to the viewport width\n        - the parent size does not matter\n    - viewport height\n        - sizing relative to the viewport height\n        - the parent size does not matter\n    - Commonly used in creating full screen landing pages\n    - Also commonly used in full screen elements, such as\n        - cookie warnings\n        - overlay images\n        - overlay dialogs\n    - Also commonly used in positioning\n\n## Developer Tools!

Just a bit differently\n- Inline elements\n        - don\'t respond to margin-top, margin-bottom, width or height\n        - Top and bottom values do not push other elements or rows of text\n        - Inline elements are contained vertically in a line of text\n- Inline vs Block\n        - It\'s just the value of `display`\n        - Inline elements are elements with a "display" value of "inline"\n        - Block elements are just elements with a default "display" of "block"\n        - You can control this!\n        - `display: block;`\n        - `display: inline;`\n        - `display: none;`\n        - `display: inline-block;`\n                - Hybrid between the block and the inline elements\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n',te=t(2),oe=t(3);function ie(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(te,{remarkPlugins:[oe],children:se})})}var se='\n# UIB - More backgrounds!\n\n## Backgrounds yeah!\n\n- `background-image` - for decoration, not content\n        - You can have multiple background images and a background color!\n        - background-color: lightcyan;\n        - background-image: url("bg.png"), url("bg2.png");\n- `background-repeat` - controls how our background image is repeated\n        - background-repeat: no-repeat; - does not repeat\n        - background-repeat: repeat-x; - repeats horizontally\n        - background-repeat: repeat-y; - repeats vertically\n        - background-repeat: round; - repeats, but rounds the image sizes\n        - background-repeat: space; - repeats, images get spaced according to the available space\n- `background-size`\n        - background-size: 100px; - defines a width of 100px, height gets automatically calculated\n                - maintains aspect ratio\n        - background-size: 100px 100px; - width 100px, height 100px\n                - does not maintain aspect ratio\n        - background-size: cover - the background attempts to cover the containing box\n        - background-size: contain - the background attempts to be shown completely in the containing box\n- background-position\n        - background-position: top; - centered, at the top of the containing box\n        - background-position: center; - centered horizontally and vertically\n        - background-position: left; - centerd vertically, to the left of the box\n        - background-position: right; - centerd vertically, to the right of the box\n        - background-position: 10px 100px; - 10 px from the left, 100px from the top        \n- setting multiple attributes with the `background` shorthand\n        - `background: no-repeat center url("bg.png"), \n                       no-repeat center url("bg2.png");`\n        - background: green;\n        - Check MDN when and if you want to use this\n\n## Gradients!\n\n- Remember, transparency works here too!\n\n- linear gradient\n        - background: linear-gradient(#000, #F00);\n        - background: linear-gradient(#000, #F00, yellow);\n- radial gradient\n        - background: radial-gradient(red, #000, rgba(0,0,0,0));\n- conic gradient\n        - background: conic-gradient(#000, #f00, #00f, #000);\n- When creating gradients, a CSS Gradient tool is really helpful!\n        \n        \n## Positioning\n\n- Coordinate positioning\n        - Usually set with either "top" and "left" OR "bottom" and "right"\n- CSS `position`\n        - Often combined with coordinates\n        - `position: static;` - default value, element follows normal document flow\n        - `position: absolute;` - element is removed compltely from the normal flow \n                - is positioned with coordinates\n                - the element takes no space in normal document flow\n        - `position: relative;` - element is positioned relative to itself\n                - the space taken up by the element is taken normally\n        - `position: fixed;` - removed from normal document flow, relative to the viewport\n                - is positioned with coordinates\n                - ignores parent/ancestor scrolling\n        - `position: sticky;`\n                -

Usually set with either "top" and "left" OR "bottom" and "right"\n- CSS `position`\n        - Often combined with coordinates\n        - `position: static;` - default value, element follows normal document flow\n        - `position: absolute;` - element is removed compltely from the normal flow \n                - is positioned with coordinates\n                - the element takes no space in normal document flow\n        - `position: relative;` - element is positioned relative to itself\n                - the space taken up by the element is taken normally\n        - `position: fixed;` - removed from normal document flow, relative to the viewport\n                - is positioned with coordinates\n                - ignores parent/ancestor scrolling\n        - `position: sticky;`\n                - not supported by *everything*\n                - is positioned with coordinates\n                -

UI/UX - Intro to UI / UX Again!\n\n## *Interface*\n\n- Boundary between two separate concepts / components\n    - Person / Information about a company\n    - Person / Computer \u2014> Mouse, Keyboard (Human Interface Device)\n    \n## User Interface (UI)- Human - Computer interaction\n\n- Human and a website\n    - Visual (to see, a Graphical User Interface [*GUI*])\n    - Tactile (to touch, Phone tactile feedback and Braille displays)\n    - Auditory (to hear)\n- Websites are interfaces between people and information\n\n## User eXperience (UX)\n\nSee link at [https://userinyerface.com/game.html](https://userinyerface.com/game.html)\n\n## Fonts (continued)\n\nDifferent faces for different meanings, font styles:\n\n- Serif\n    - Has serifs\n    - "look authoritative, professional, suggest the weight of history or experience" - Adobe\n    - Often used in the body of newspapers and articles\n    - Can be more readable when there is very little room or the font is small\n- Sans Serif\n    - Does not have serifs\n    - Hard, minimalistic, modern feeling\n    - "Maybe a bit overused" - Joel\n    - Take up less space (narrower than serif)\n- Monospace\n    - Code\n    - ASCII art\n    - Data tables and lists\n- Cursive\n    - Real pretty\n    - Soft\n    - Modern or old looking\n    - Visual selection\n- Symbol\n    - Icons for example or emojis (windings for example)\n    - Pictures or pictographs instead of letters\n        - Meaning that letters are rendered as little text-images\n- Emoticons / Emoji are just unicode symbols similar to "A" or "7"\n    - Some fonts support these, some dont\n    - When a symbol is not supported by a font your browser tries to use some other font\n        - (Or fails miserably) - in the olden days Heikki T\xe4k\xe4l\xe4inen \u2014> Heikki T?k?l?inen\n- Choosing a font is a part of your UX / UI Design\n    - Mixing fonts is OK!\n        - For example: Sans-serif for headings, Serif for paragraphs\n- `font-family`\n    - Pre-installed system fonts: May not work for everybody, so use generics or fallbacks\n        - Fallback fonts; "font1", "banana revolution", "Arial"\n        - Generics: sans-serif, serif, monospace\n    - Using your own fonts injected via link or @import - they will just work\n- CSS `:root` pseudo-class\n    - Targets whatever the root element is\n    - Often used to define the default font\n- Getting more fonts: use @import or <link>\n    - the @import(s) needs to be before anything else in your CSS\n    - `@import "common.css" screen;`\n    - `@import "print.css" print;`\n\n## Icon font example - Fontawesome    \n\n    *NOTE* We are looking at *version 4* of Fontawesome.\n    Icon font, often used in websites\n    Icon fonts are popular because they load quickly, they are vectors (scalable)',de=t(2),he=t(3);function ue(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(de,{remarkPlugins:[he],children:me})})}var me='\n# Lessons - UI UX - Direction and stylish\n\n## Text Direction\n\n- Writing text from Left to Right and Right to Left\n    - Hebrew or Arabic\n    - HTML `dir="rtl"`\n        - Inherited from parent to children!\n    - CSS `direction: rtl;`\n    - Default is `ltr`\n    \n## Text Alignment\n\n- Align text with\n    - `text-align: center;`\n    - `text-align: justify;`\n    - `text-align: right;`\n    \n## Stylish text\n\n- `font-weight`\n    - normal, bold\n        - 100\n        - 200\n        - 300\n        - 400 \u2014 "normal"\n        - 500\n        - 600\n        - 700 \u2014 "bold"\n        - 800\n        - 900\n    - Which ones work, depends on the font **family**\n        - "Arial"\n- `font-style`\n    - italic, normal are the usual values\n    - ~~"oblique" exists, rarely used~~\n- `text-decoration`\n    - `text-decoration: underline;` is a shorthand\n        - `text-decoration-line`\n        - `text-decoration-color`\n        - `text-decoration-style`\n    - `green wavy underline`\n    - `underline overline blue`\n    - `line-through`\n- `text-transform`\n    - uppercase, lowercase, capitalize\n- `text-shadow`\n    - `1px 2px 26px #ff0000`\n        - 1px offset to the right\n        - 2px offset to the bottom\n        - 26px blur amount\n        - #ff0000 color\n- `::before` , `::after`, `content`\n    - before and after are pseudo-elements\n        - two colons for pseudo-elements\n        - one colon for pseudo-classes\n    - content defines some kind of content in relation to the selector',pe=t(2),be=t(3);function ge(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(pe,{remarkPlugins:[be],children:je})})}var je='\n# UIB - FontAwesome & Boxes revisited\n\n## Fontawesome revisited\n\n- Conveys meaning without text using icons\n- Register and sign in to use the easy method of injecting a script and FA "just works"\n    - OR: Download FA locally and use (link) it like any other CSS file (the fonts will be included automatically then too)\n- Note! You have to use the correct code (like Joel did not, thanks Rudesh!)\n- FontAwesome is a Font icon library - fonts are vectors!\n- Not the only Icon Font Library\n    - Self-study: alternatives to FA; flaticon, thenounproject.com\n    \n## Everything is a Box!\n\n- The Box Model\n- Boxes are made up of a few different parts inside out:\n    - Content / Content area\n    - Padding\n    - Border\n    - Margin\n- When we define a CSS box width, it targets the content area (padding, border, margin are not counted as the width)\n- IF we use `box-sizing: border-box` - the padding and border are included in the width\n- Different types of boxes\n    - Block (Block-level elements)\n        - div, p, section, h1...\n    - Inline (elements)\n        - b, i, span, a, strong, em...\n        - In line with text, like a part of text\n        - Cannot have height, width\n        - Padding and margin work, but top and bottom don\'t move other content away\n    - Inline blocks\n        - Mostly done ourselves with CSS\n        - Can have height, width\n        - Padding, margin work\n        - `vertical-align: middle`\n            - Aligns the inline-block  element within its current line of text (often moves the line of text a bit too!)\n    -

UIUX - Design\n\n## Basic principles of UI design\n\n- Structure (Overall UI architecture)\n        - Organize the UI meaningully and usefully\n        - Use clear & consistent models that are recognizable\n        - Put related things together, separate unrelated things\n                - Company metadata section\n                        - About us, Jobs, Media, History, Campuses\n                - Products section\n                        - Search, Promotions, Lookbooks, etc..\n        - Differentiate dissimilar things, make similar things resemble each other\n- Simplicity\n        - Design should make simple, common tasks easy\n        - Communicate clearly and simply in the users own language\n        - Provide good shortcuts that are meaningully related to longer procedures\n- Visibility\n        - Make all needed options and materials visible\n        - Don\'t distract the user with extra or redundant information\n        - Don\'t overwhelm the user with alternatives or confuse with unneeded information\n- Feedback\n        - Keep the user informed of\n                - Actions or interpretations\n                - Changes of state\n                - Errors or exceptions that are relevat to the user\n        - Feedback should clear, concise and unambiguous (an in a language familiar to the user)\n- Tolerance\n        - Design should be flexible and tolerant\n        - Reduce the cost of mistakes and misuse by allowing undo / redo\n        - Prevent errors when possible by tolerating varied inputs and sequences\n        - Interpret all reasonable actions\n- Reuse\n        - The design should reuse internal and external componets and behaviours\n        - Maintain consistency with purpose rather than arbitrary consistency\n        - Reduce teh need for users to rethink and remember\n        \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_user_interface_design\n\n- Additionally, focus on design consistency and components\n        - Elements look the same everywhere\n        - Space between elements is consistent\n        - Buttons look similar etc\n\n## Designing with Colors!\n\n- Branding is important here!\n        - Tiffany.de -- The "Tiffany" blue\n        - Fiskars.com -- The "Fiskars" orange\n        - Fazer.com -- The "Fazer" blue\n- You often have one primary or main color\n        - That doesn\'t mean to make _everything_ that color\n        - Primary color does not mean background color\n        - You can have a dark AND a light version using the same color palette!\n        - "A tamer primary color and a brighter accent color gives apps a bold, colorful look without overwhelming the content"\n- In addition to the primary color, you\'ll most likely have a set of others too!\n        - Secondary or Accent color\n        - Plus others, I\'d advise to have at least three colors\n        - Accent colors, like the The "Fiskars" orange *could* be used in\n                - Buttons\n                - Hover action hilights\n                - Controls (sliders, switches, inputs...)\n                - Hilighted text, Progress bars\n                - Links and Headlines\n- Selecting colors\n        - It\'s easiet to start with one main color / starting point\n        - It\'s easiest and simplest to use a generator\n                - coolors.co\n                - https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel\n                - *Self study hint* https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-and-palettes\n\n- Design guidelines document example\n        - Color palette\n        - Content examples\n        - Component examples\n        - A mature version of of this would be Material UI\n\n## More on color!\n        \n- Hue\n        - Color in its pure form\n- Saturation\n        - The intensity or purity of a hue -- vivid, bright\n        - A very saturated website: neopets.com\n- Lightness - the relative degree of black / white mixed with a give hue\n        - A lot of black - a duller color\n- Tempretarure\n        - To make a color warmer, add orange or yellow\n        - To make a color colder, add blue\n\n*notes on color*\n- Color meaning might vary from culture to culture\n- Accessibility is relevant when choosing a color palette\n- When learning, it\'s a good idea try to implement nice looking designs from other websites\n- Experiment with textures too!\n        - https://wesbos.com/\n        - Footer at fazer.com\n\n## An example on color usage - light and shadows\n\n- Shadows convey elevation\n- You can use text and box shadows to emulate a light source\n\n## Further research suggestions\n\n-  (Podcast) https://syntax.fm/show/196/design-foundations-for-developers\n        - Syntax is a fantastic podcast generally, but the other topics are a bit more advanced usually\n- https://mockplus.com/blog/post/learn-ui-design (quick read, has good links to resources)\n- https://whydoweinterface.com/ (longer read, like a book with for example historical info rather than a tutorial, also a great looking website!)',Oe=t(2),ve=t(3);function ke(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(Oe,{remarkPlugins:[ve],children:Se})})}var Se='\n# UI Basics - data - Tables are awesome!!\n\n## Organizing Data in Tables\n\n- Tables are only for tabular data, never for layout\n  - This was done back in the bad old days, even before float layouts\n  - Bad for accessibility, Not flexible\n- Elements\n  - `<table>` -> element that has `display: table` and is semantically a table\n  - `<tr>` and `<td>`\n  - `<thead>`\n  - `<tbody>`\n  - `<tfoot>`\n  - `<th scope=[...]>`\n    - scope used just for screen readers, but can be targeted with CSS attribute selectors\n- Faker VSCode extension\n- Spanning rows and columns - `<td rowspan=""..."">`, `<td colspan=""..."">`\n- `<caption>` (optional)\n- Don\'t use the border="" attribute (or other deprecated attributes)\n\n\n## Styling Tables\n\n- Borders with css\n  -   border-collapse: collapse; OR border-spacing: 0.5rem; <-- for the table\n  -   border: 1px solid #999; <-------------------------------- for the cells\n\n- Zebra stripes using `pseudo child selectors`\n- Pseudo child selectors (tr:first-child means that when the TR is the first child)\n  - `:first-child`\n  - `:last-child`\n  - `:nth-child() { ... }`\n    - even, odd, 3, 3n, 3n+1\n    - for example\n        tr:nth-child(even) td {\n            background-color: #ddd;\n        }\n\n- Easy (easier) layout with `table-layout: fixed`\n- Additional info with <caption>\n    <table style="caption-side: bottom;">\n      <caption>Table 1.1 Customers</caption>\n      <tr>\n      ---\n- Caption placement with `caption-side` bottom/top\n\n**Further reading**\n  https://css-tricks.com/complete-guide-table-element/\n  https://css-tricks.com/fixing-tables-long-strings/\n',Te=t(2),Ce=t(3);function Be(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(Te,{remarkPlugins:[Ce],children:Ie})})}var Ie='\n# UIB -

Websites only support from some known smallest res.\n                - Min-width defined or a static width\n        - With the 1st smartphones (iPhone =))\n                - a LOT of zooming, bad UX\n        - First response to smartphones was to create separate sites\n                - www.example.org / m.example.org\n                - Server identifies browser through User Agent Strings\n               \n        - The current approach *usually* is to create one website\n                - Responds to the browser width\n                        - --\x3e responsive website\n         \n        - Two approaches to responsivity:\n                - Desktop first\n                        - The "default" way\n                        - You develop the website specifically for desktop use\n                        - You add mobile support later (if you do!)\n                - Mobile first\n                        - You develop the website specifically for mobile use\n                        - You add desktop support later\n                        - Quickly gaining support\n                        - Might be more popular today\n                        - Concidered the easier approach when supporting both\n                - Also, tablets exist\n                        - But not as a design / implementation starting point\n\n        - Mobile is the current and the future leader\n                - Of course, depends on your users\n                \n        - Mobile first presentations!\n       \n## Code!\n\n### Viewport meta tag\n\n- First things first, ensure proper scale \n    <meta\n      name="viewport"\n      content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"\n    />\n- On mobile devices, the viewport is actually kind of virtual\n        - Mobiles render pages inside a virtual window/viewport\n        - Virtual window is usually wider than the screen\n        - Users would pan and zoom too the different areas of the page\n        - For example, a mobile could have a screen width of 640px\n                - pages might be rendered with a vitual viewport of 980px\n                - the 980px will be shrunk down to fit the 640px\n        \n        - This is done because many pages are not (yet) mobile optimized\n        - The virtual viewport makes non-optimized pages at least work somehow\n        - Devices use virtual pixels as well, complicating this further\n- Our Viewport meta tag resets this.\n\n### Support different screen sizes - Media queries\n\n- CSS at-rules\n- Media query structure `@media [media-type] ([media-features]) {}`\n        - media-type: screen and print (and speech)\n                - "Is the website rendered on a screen?"\n                - "Is the website printed?"\n                - "screen" is the default and you can leave this out.\n        - media-features\n                - Common features\n                - Identifies features active in the current media\n                - A lot of different ones to target\n                - Two main ones for responsivity: min-width & max-width\n                - *Self-study* See more on MDN\n\n- Example 1:\n        `@media (min-width: 600px) {}` <-- Basic media query\n\n        \n- Example 1 with CSS:\n\n        .header {\n                margin: 50px;\n        }        \n\n        @media (min-width: 600px) {\n        \n                .header {\n                        margin: 10px;\n                }\n        \n        }\n\n- The 600px here is called a breakpoint\n        - Often you will have multiple breakpoints in your CSS\n        - There are many lists of good breakpoint values to use\n        - For example, it\'s common to use the breakpoint list from Bootsrap\n                - Google "Bootsrap breakpoints"\n        - You don\'t always need to implement all breakpoint sizes\n                - Choose what makes sense to you\n        - Example breakpoints from Bootstrap\n          @media (min-width: 576px) { ... } // phones\n          @media (min-width: 768px) { ... } // tablets\n          @media (min-width: 992px) { ... } // desktops\n          @media (min-width: 1200px) { ... } // large desktops\n          @media (min-width: 1400px) { ... } // xtra large desktops\n\n## Responsivity and text\n- The `vw` unit: don\'t use for text, overrides desktop zoom\n\n\n\n',Re=t(2),Fe=t(3);function He(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(Re,{remarkPlugins:[Fe],children:We})})}var We='\n# UIB -

Draw a flowchart, how will the user accomplish things?\n                - Analog or Digital\n                - Figma, Draw.io\n        2. Draw a rough pen-and paper wireframe of the key views\n                - This could include mobile views and desktop views\n                - Actual pen and paper, Mouse and Gimp or even Figma\n        3. Draw a digital wireframe of the pages\n                - Figma\n                - Might show to clients, might help sales\n        4. Draw a full design (or create a full design system)\n                - Figma again, perhaps? Sketch?\n        5. Implement that design etc\n\n- As web professionals, the border between Designer and Developer\n        is not super clear cut\n- Wireframe\n        - Like a rough sketch, no colors, no real content maybe etc.\n        - Different kinds of wireframes from lofi to hifi\n\n- In big projects, often you will continuously do parts 1-5 at the same time\n- Digital wireframing with Figma for example\n- Figma\n        - Digital Wireframing, charts, websites, design systems and more\n        - Needs registering\n        - Very collaborative, many users can work on the same project\n                - And share their work too!\n        - A huge library of templates/toolkits that you can use and buy\n\n\n                \n## Flexbox\n- "Flexible box model"\n- Display value for boxes, often divs / sections etc\n- "flex" is another value for `display`; `display: flex;`\n        -

The default value is 0\n    - Default: flex items are in the order that they appear in your HTML\n    - Can have negative values too!\n    - You can reverse the order with `flex-direction: row-reverse;`\n    - Also works with `flex-direction: column;`\n- `flex-grow: 1`;\n    - The default value is 0\n    - When applied to an item, the item will scale relative to the sum of the size of all other items on the same row\n    - If none of the flex items have flex-grow, they don\'t grow\n- `flex-basis: 200px;`\n    - The width or height (depends on flex-direction) of a flex item\n    - If width and flex-basis are both set, width is ignored!\n    - Normal CSS units, like "px" and "%"\n    - More dynamic than width;\n        - IF the available space is less than required, automatically applies flex-shrink, fitting the items to the available space\n    - Recommended over width\n    - Often used in combination with height\n- - `flex-shrink: 1;`\n    - The default value is 1\n    - Used in combination with `flex-wrap: nowrap` (default)\n    - Determines the rate at which an item will shrink in relation to all items in the container when there is not enough room for all of them\n    - Defines the ability for a flex item to shrink, if necessary\n- `flex`\n    - Shorthand for `[flex-grow] [flex-shrink] [flex-basis]`\n    - By default these are `flex: 0 1 auto;`\n    - Can be confusing!\n    - Often just used for flex-grow OR all thee of them\n    - Recommendation to use either 1 value or 3 values:\n        - `flex: 1;`\n        - `flex: 1 1 33%;`\n    - Check MDN if you are unsure!\n\n- `align-self`\n    - Works like `align-items: flex-end;`, but for the children\n    - Can be set to just one child element\n    - Overrides `align-items` from the parent\n    \n- The perfect center\n    - `display: flex;` and `margin: auto;`\n    - might be useful for example in popover - overlays\n        - cookie acceptance\n        - spam messages\n- Responsive website = media queries + flexbox\n    - Work as usual',Ve=t(2),$e=t(3);function qe(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(Ve,{remarkPlugins:[$e],children:Ke})})}var Ke='\n# UIB -

There is no need to abandon one for the other\n    - Flexbox is one-dimensional\n    - Grid is two-dimensional-  \n    \n- `display: grid;`\n    - Defines an element to be a grid container\n    - Its children become grid items\n- `grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;`\n    - Defines the width and number of columns\n    - The column widths accept CSS units\n    - The unit most used with grids is "fr" (fraction)\n    - When using fr, the widths are automatically calculated\n    - Fr is recommended over percentages due to margin/padding issues\n- `gap: 1em;` - defines the space between elements\n- `grid-auto-rows: 100px;` - defines row height, overflow danger!\n- `grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);`\n    - Defines the minimum and the maximum row height\n    - "auto" is the default, means height grows with content\n- You can use minmax with `grid-template-columns: ;` too!\n    - `grid-template-columns: minmax(50px, 100px) 1fr 200px;`\n- `background-attachment: fixed` looks super good!',Xe=t(2),_e=t(3);function Qe(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(Xe,{remarkPlugins:[_e],children:Ze})})}var Ze='\n# UIB -

`grid-column: 1 / 3;`\n        - Make this cell start from column line 1 and end in column line 3 (takes up two vertical tracks)\n        - "span" keyword - these are exactly the same\n            - grid-column: 2 / 4;\n            -

www.sassmeister.com\n    - .sass files\n    - https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules\n- SCSS\n    - After the original SASS\n    - "Sassy CSS"\n    - More CSS-like\n    - SASS Superpowers, like NESTING\n    - Much more popular\n    - Backwards compatible with CSS\n    - We will be focusing on this!\n    - .scss files\n    - https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules\n\n- Now: Two file types, .scss and .sass\n    - Different languages / markups\n    - Both are referred to as SASS :facepalm:\n    - Other options exist too, such as "Less"\n\n- SASS/SCSS/LESS/etc...\n    - CSS Preprocessors\n    - We "transpile" SCSS code to get CSS\n        - Transpile = Convert from *Langage A* to *Language B*\n            --\x3e Source-to-source translate\n            --\x3e Source-to-source compiling\n            --\x3e Transcompiling\n            --\x3e Transpiling\n        - Transpiled languages are generally on the same "level" and of the same complexity\n    - How do we transpile?\n\n## Example Workflow for SCSS --\x3e CSS\n\n1. Install "sass" tool using NPM\n- `npm install --global sass`\n2. Run the "sass" tool\n- `sass [inputfile] [outputfile]`\n- `sass --watch style.scss banana.css`\n\n## Build scripts: Using NPM as a build tool\n\n- Example boilerplate project with a workflow developed by DCI\n- https://github.com/FbW-E01/dci-boilerplate-I\n- READ THE README.MD DOCUMENTATION\n- Key commands\n    - `npm install` - install dependencies\n    - `npm start` - start development server\n    - `npm run build` - build production version\n    - `npm run deploy` - deploy to Github Pages\n\n## SASS Variables\n\n- What is a variable?\n    - Box for storing a value\n    - Referenced from many places in code (CSS or other code!)\n- Defining a SASS variable\n    - `$[name]: [value]`\n- Using a SASS variable\n    - `color: $[name]`\n\n### OVERRIDING BOOTSTRAP COLORS IN THE DCI PROJECT BOILERPLATE\n\n- Custom\n    $red: #dd3d2d;\n    $green: #33ff44;\n    color: $red;\n- To maps\n    $colors: (\n        "red": #dd3d2d,\n        "green": #33ff44\n    );\n\n    p {\n        color: map-get($colors, "red");\n    }\n- Bootsrap overrides\n    $theme-colors: (\n        "primary": orange\n    );\n    $border-radius:99999px;\n    BEFORE THE IMPORT\n- Look at Bootstrap source code',mn=t(2),pn=t(3);function bn(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(mn,{remarkPlugins:[pn],children:gn})})}var gn='\n# UIB 30 - SASS continued\n\n## Mixins\n\n"Predefined reusable rulesets"\n    @mixin coolbox {\n        border: 2px solid double;\n        border-radius: 10px;\n        padding: 10px;\n    }\n    .card {\n        background: lightblue;\n        @include coolbox;\n    }\n    .example {\n        background: palegreen;\n        @include coolbox;\n    }\n    button {\n        @include coolbox;\n    }\n\n## You can add parameters!\n\n    @mixin bordered($width, $color) {\n        border: $width solid $color;\n        border-radius: $width;\n    }\n    .card {\n        background: lightblue;\n        @include bordered(1px, red);\n    }\n\n## One of the main uses for mixins\n\nBootsrap has some mixins!\n\n    // media-breakpoint-up\n        // @media (min-width: ...) {}\n\n    // media-breakpoint-down\n        // @media (max-width: ...) {}\n\n    // media-breakpoint-between\n        // @media (min-width: ...) and (max-width: ...) {}\n\n    // For example:\n    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {\n        nav {\n            background: red;\n        }\n    }\n\n# Importing stuff!\n\nSometimes it makes sense to split your projects SCSS/SASS into multiple files.

compilation and interpretation\n      - Python, Java, C# .net applications\n      - Compiled into and Intermediate Language (IL)\n      - The IL the executable is run in an interpreter\n\n- JavaScript, ECMAScript -- JS, ES\n  - We needed to make the web DYNAMIC\n  - Java was super trendy back then...\n    - And they needed a name....\n  - JS = 10 days of work, written for Netscape\n    - Originally named Mocha, then named LiveScript\n    - Then for Marketing reasons named "JavaScript"\n  - Miscrosoft made their own version\n    - JScript\n  - Very quickly, a standard was needed and made\n    - European Computer Manufacturers Association\n    - A.C.M.A.Script --\x3e ECMAScript (ES)\n    - ECMAScript is the standard\n    - JavaScript is the language based on the ES standard\n    - ES version history is weird and political\n    - For a long time, JS (and web dev in general)\n      - Very fragmented... until jQuery\n        - jQuery = Write JS that can work for every browser\n      - With a new version of ECMAScript and thus JavaScript\n        - The fragmentation issue was fixed... ish\n        - NOW, jQuery is no longer that needed\n        - This version was ES 5\n    - ES and JS are living, they are being constantly developed\n      - Now the most popular version is ES 6\n      - But the versions are a bit confusing...\n\n  - Also, TypeScript exists\n    - TypeScript code needs to be "compiled" to JavaScript\n    - An extension of JS\n    - JavaScript with Typing\n    - file.js --- file.ts\n\n\n"Anything that CAN be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript"\n\n## Variables and running the code\n\n- Node\n  - Node.JS - NodeJS - Node\n  - A way of running JS on your computer directly\n  - No browser needed at all\n  - We will focus workin in Node because:\n    - It\'s straightforward\n    - It has good fundamental concepts\n    - Node is FAST\n    - Node can do most things\n    - Learning Node will benefit you in the future!\n- Running JS files with node\n  - `$ node start.js`\n\n- **ERRORS**\n  - We need to get used to errors!\n  - How to read them, how to deal with them!\n  - *Read the error message*\n  - The stuff at the bottom is called a stack trace\n    - Can be useful\n    - Let\'s leave that stuff for the future!\n\n- Variables\n  - JS has three ways of making a variable:\n    - `const foo = "Hello world!";`\n      - constant, value cannot be changed\n      - Most of your variables usually are consts\n    - `let bar = "Something else!";`\n      - Value can be changed!\n      - Second most used\n    - `var baz = "Woohooo variables!";`\n      - Value can be changed\n      - Avoid using this!\n\n- Run a file and actually see something?\n  - `console.log(foo);`\n    - Super important tool\n    - Don\'t worry too much what it does for now\n    - Use to output the value of a variable\n    - Use to output messages directly\n\n- If you run `node` without any arguments\n  - It opens on a Node `REPL`\n  - REPL = Read, Evaluate, Print Loop\n  - Node environment that runs whatever you type in it continuously\n  - Useful for quick testing\n  - To get out of it, press Ctrl+c\n\n- Variables continued\n  - `const`\n    - Use this by default\n    - If you have to change the value, use `let`\n    - Constants protect you from yourself :)\n    - Best practice to always use these\n\nThe `const`, `let`, `var` only need to be present\nwhen you declare the variable\n\n- Declaration and Assignment\n  - We can *Declare* a variable and *Assign* it a value separately\n    - `let message;`\n    - `message = "Hello";`\n  - Or we can do this together\n    - `let greeting = "Hi!";`\n  - Except...\n    - For const we have to declare and assign always together :D \n\n- Experiments with declaring and assigning\n  - Log variable without declaring\n    - `ReferenceError: message is not defined`\n  - Log variable *BEFORE* declaring\n    - `ReferenceError: Cannot access \'message\' before initialization`\n    - Except for `var` variables\n      - `var` variables get "Hoisted" before our console.log.\n  - Log variable before assigning a value\n    - This is fine!\n    - The value of the variable is "undefined";\n      - Special JS value, different from empty\n    - Assign without declaring?\n      - Automatic declaration\n      - Avoid this, always use const or let\n\n*Lunch break*\n\n- A word on naming conventions!\n  - JavaScript tends to use camelCase naming\n  - Another option would be for example snake_case\n  - 1. Keep it consistent\n  - For variables, keep the first letter lowercase\n  - Let\'s use camelCase\n  - Naming things is really hard!\n    - Depends a lot on the situation!\n  - It\'s OK to spend a bit of time thinking about it\n  - It\'s OK to change variable names\n  - I usually try to keep then short\n\n*TASK* PB-solutions\n\n## Data types\n\nProgramming langauges all have built-in data structures, which differ from one languages to another.\n\nJS is a "loosely typed" and "dynamic" language. Variables in JS are not directly association with any particular value type. Any variable and be assigned and re-assigned values of all types.\n\n- Primitive Data Types\n  - String\n    - `const name = "Potato McPotatohead";`\n  - Numbers\n    - `const age = 42;`\n    - `const pi = 3.14;`\n  - Booleans\n    - `const active = true;`\n    - `const hidden = false;`\n  - Null\n    - Not actually technically a primitive\n    - This means an empty value\n    - `const postBox = null;`\n  - Undefined\n    - Something that does not exist YET or ANYMORE\n    - This means that a value doesn\'t exist\n  - Two other primitives:\n    - BigInt, Symbol\n\n- Objects\n  - Can be seen as a collection of properties\n  - Keys and Values\n  - Object Literal:\n    "We have literally written out the object contents"\n    const user = {\n      name: "Joel",\n      age: 25,\n      city: "Windhoek"\n    };\n  - JSON\n    - JavaScript Object Notation\n  - We can look up or refer to the properties (values inside) using a few diferent ways, this is the best one:\n    - `console.log(user.firstName);`\n    - dot notation\n\n- Arrays\n  - Represent a list of things\n    - List of fruit\n    - List of languages etc\n  - Basically the same as Objects, but\n    - Automatic keys based on numbers\n    - Special "length" property\n  - `const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Tomato"];`\n\nTo help with types, we have an "operator" called `typeof`',Sn=t(2),Tn=t(3);function Cn(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(Sn,{remarkPlugins:[Tn],children:Bn})})}var Bn='\n# PB - Language - 2\n\nYesterday we did:\n  - node\n  - const, let, var\n  - declare and assign\n  - console.log(...)\n  - Types\n    - String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined\n    - Object, Array\n  - JSON\n\n## Statements\n\n- A program is a collection of instructions to perform\n- In a language, these are called statements\n- A JS program is just a list of statements.\n- In JS multiple statements may occur on a single line\n  - (If separated by a semicolon `;`)\n- In JS, one statement may span multiple lines\n- Many kinds of statements\n- Statements end in semicolons\n- The Semicolon\n  - It is not required, but highly recommended\n  - No semicolons = Implicit semicolons\n    - They are automatically added\n  - In most cases, a "newline" implies a semicolon\n    - But not always, like in the multi-line log\n  - No semicolons *usually* works, but not always\n\n## Comments\n  - Single-line comments\n    - They look like this: `// Comment!`\n    - They are used for documentation\n    - Or temporarily disabling lines of code\n    - You can have statements and a single line comment on the same line\n  - Multi-line comments - or "Block comments"\n    - They look like this: `/* Something */`\n    - Sometimes you see comments like this\n      - /** blag */\n      - "Doc" or "Documentation" comments\n    - They are used for documentation\n    - Or temporarily disabling lines of code\n    - You can have fancy versions\n\n*TASK* Language statements\n\n## Expressions\n\nAny unit of code that can be evaluated to a value, is an expression.\n\nExpressions can appear anywhere in a program where JS expects a value.\n\nThree types of expressions:\n  - To check the type we can use `typeof`\n  - There are TONS of these in JavaScript\n  - String expressions\n    - *Evaluate to a String*\n    - "Potato"\n    - "Toma" + "to" // String concatenation\n    - \'Aubergine\'\n    - "Straw" + \'berry\'\n    - `typeof counter`\n  - Arithmetic expressions (Mathematical expressions)\n    - *Evaluate to a numeric value*\n    - There are a LOT of these, you DO NOT need to know all of them\n    - 10\n    - 10.6\n    - 10+5, 10-5\n    - 10*5, 10/5\n    - 10*2/5\n    - 10*(2/5)\n    - 2%3 -- "Remainder" or "Modulo"\n    - `let counter = 0; counter = counter + 1;`\n    - Increment and Decerement\n      - `counter++` - post increment\n      - `++counter` - pre increment\n        // Counter++\n        //  A) console.log(counter++);\n        console.log(counter);\n        counter = counter + 1;\n\n        // ++Counter\n        // B) console.log(++counter);\n        counter = counter + 1;\n        console.log(counter);\n      - Decement is the same as Increment, except with minus\n      - Usually used in counters\n  - Logical / Boolean expressions\n    - *Evaluate to a boolean value*\n    - *Evaluate to either true or false*\n    - `true`\n    - `10>9` - "greater than"; always evaluates to "true"\n    - `10>=9` - "greater than or equal to"\n    - `10<=9` - "smaller than or equal to"\n    - `newPassword === oldPassword`\n    - `username === "admin"` - checks equality\n    - `username !== "admin"` - checks inequality\n\n## Changing variables\n\n- Variable reassignment\n  - `userCount = 71;`\n  - `userName = "John";`\n  - `monkeys++;`\n  - Here the "=" and the "++" are operators\n  - New operators for variable reassignment\n    - `+=` - For strings, we add the new value to the end of the old\n    - `+=` - For numbers, we add the new value to the old\n    - `-=` - For numbers, we substract the new value from the old\n- Changing a variable = changing the state of the application\n- State of the application = the value of all variables at a given time\n\n- A difficult word: Ternary operator `?`\n  - Easiest to show with an example\n  ```\n    let errorCount = 8;\n    // This is a ternary:\n    const message = (errorCount > 5) ? "Too many errors!" : "OK!";\n    console.log(message);\n  ```\n\n## Strings\n\n- Special characters\n  - Escaping; in JS you escape characters in Strings using backslash `\\`, examples:\n  - \'Johnny "Teacher" O\'malley\';\n  - "Joel "Teacher" Peltonen";\n  - \n has a special meaning; newline character\n    - console.log(\'Hello\nWorld!\';)\n\n- Template literals --\x3e using expressions within Strings\n  - console.log(`Awesomeness level reached: ${(userCount + newUsers) > 75}`);\n\n- Getting the length of a String\n  - Just like with Arrays\n  - `username.length`\n\n- Getting a character from a string\n  - Bracket notation / Index notation\n  ```\n    const myName = "Joel";\n    console.log(myName[0]);\n    console.log(myName[1]);\n    console.log(myName[2]);\n    console.log(myName[3]);\n    console.log(myName[4]);\n    console.log(myName[5]);\n  ```\n',In=t(2),An=t(3);function Pn(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(In,{remarkPlugins:[An],children:Mn})})}var Mn='\n# PB - Language - 3\n\n## Review from yesterday\n\n- Statements\n  - The definition is vague\n  - Generally; the bits of code separated by a semicolon are statements\n  - Guideline: one statement per line, ending in a semicolon\n    - Semicolons are generally optional, but very recommended\n    - Except not always\n\n      console.log("Hello my name is " + user.name +\n                  " and I live in " + user.homeCity +\n                  "!");\n\n- Expressions\n  - A bit of code that evaluates to a value\n  - Few different kinds\n    - string (string concatenation: "foo" + "bar" )\n    - number (Mathematical expressions / Arithmetic expressions: counter++)\n    - boolean (true, 10>9)\n- Operators\n  - In JS there are TONS of these operators, here is a few:\n  - Assigment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`\n  - Addition operator: `+`\n  - Multiplication operator: `*`\n  - Comparison operators: `===`, `!==`, `>`, `>=`\n  - Increment operator: `++`\n  - Decrement operator: `--`\n  - Type operator: `typeof`\n  - Ternary operator: `?`\n    - `let message = (counter > 999) ?

"5" means the 6th character\n  - `"Potatoes gonna potate".slice(0, 6)` // returns "Potato"\n  - `"Potatoes gonna potate".slice(-6)` // returns "potate"\n  - Ye Olde Substring, best to avoid...\n    - `"Potatoes gonna potate".substring(5)` // Zero based!\n    - `"Potatoes gonna potate".substring(0, 6)` // returns "Potato"\n    - `"Potatoes gonna potate".substring(-6)` // returns "potate"....?\n- COMBO! COMBINATION!\n  - This technique is called chaining\n  - `"boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew".slice(9).toUpperCase();`\n- Checking if a string is inside another string\n  - `email.toLowerCase().includes("hotmail")`\n  - `"trust".includes("us");` // You can\'t spell trust without us\n  - `"TRUST".includes("us");` // Except when you can :)\n  - `"teamwork".includes("I");` // There is no I in teamwork\n\n- Removing extra whitespace / Removing padding spaces\n  - `"     I     LIKE    TURTLES      ".trim();`\n  - `"       \n     Potato".trim();`\n\n\n',Ln=t(2),Dn=t(3);function Nn(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(Ln,{remarkPlugins:[Dn],children:Un})})}var Un='\n# PB - language - 4\n\nYesterday:\n\n  - "rabbits".toUpperCase(); // produces "RABBITS"\n  - "PUPPIES".toLowerCase(); // produces "puppies"\n  - "Hello".slice(1); // produces "ello"\n  - "Hello".slice(1, 3); // produces "el"\n  - "Hello".slice(-1); // produces "o"\n  - "Hello".slice(1, -1); // produces "ell"\n  - "Hello"[0] // produces "H"\n  - greet[greet.length - 1]; // produces "o" if greet is "Hello"\n  - "teamwork".includes("I"); // produces false\n  - "   \n\n\n Hello!   \n".trim(); // produces "Hello!";\n  - Calling `parseInt(variableName)` or `parseFloat(variableName)`...\n    - doesn\'t change the original variable\n\n## Numbers\n\n- number is a type in javascript\n- Integers and Floats\n  - Theory\n    - Integer = Whole numbers\n    - Floats = Floating point number\n      - Not a whole number\n      - In different languages, there are similar concepts\n        - often with small differences;\n        - float, decimal, double\n  - JS does not separate floats and integers\n    - Every number is just a number\n    - The JS number accuracy is not that good\n  - Converting strings into numbers: `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()`\n    - `parseInt("71")` // produced the number 71\n    - `parseInt("71blue")` // produced the number 71\n    - `parseInt("hello123")` // produced NaN\n    - `parseInt("12.34")` // produced 12\n    - `parseFloat("12.35")` // produced 12.35\n    - `parseFloat("12.35 euro")` // produces the number 12.35\n\n*task*\n\n## Number pitfalls\n\n- Dealing with `NaN`\n  - "Not a Number"\n  - The type of `NaN` is `number`\n    - So, NaN is a kind of special number\n  - Dealing with it;\n    - `isNaN("potato" / 6);` // check if something is NaN\n  - Example of a NaN causing problems in this old JS joke:\n    - "b" + "a" + +"a" + "a"\n\n- Very big numbers\n  - `e` - exponent in numbers\n    - `e` is the same as `"times 10 to the power of"`\n  - Examples\n    - 5e2 === 500 === "5 times 10 to the power of 2"\n    - 5e3 === 5000 === "5 times 10 to the power of 3"\n    - 4.2e6 === 4200000 === "4.2 times 10 to the power of 6"\n    - 5e+51\n    - 4e2  --- 400\n    - 4e-2 --- 0.04\n    - -4e-4 -- -0.0004\n  \n\n- JS is not great at accuracy...\n  - When you have BIG number, javascript makes mistakes\n  - When you have an accurate number, javascript makes mistakes\n  - The bigger you go, you lose accuracy\n  - The more accurate a number is, you lose accuracy\n  - Rounding mistakes are common in JS\n  - Rounding mistakes and losing accuracy is a byproduct of how numbers are stored\n  - For these reasons, comparing large or decimal numbers is difficult\n  - There is one tool that we can use to help;\n    - Number function `toFixed(...)`\n      - "How many numbers to show after the dot"\n      - `const num = 4.0000000000006;`\n      - `console.log(num.toFixed(3))` // this logs the string \'4.000\'\n      - `console.log(num.toFixed(1))` // this logs the string \'4.000\'\n  - Big numbers and accurate numbers can be stored, but as numbers grow larger, they lose more and more accuracy.\n\n- Division pitfalls: Dealing with Infinity\n  - Special number in JS\n  - You get this for example when doing 1/0\n\n      SORRY :( Hopefully the recording works!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Math\n\n`Math` is a standard built-in object in JS. With `Math` you have lots of built in functions for mathetmatical operations. We will cover a few of them:\n\n- Rounding numbers up with `Math.ceil()`\n  - `const smallNumber = 7.1;`\n  - `console.log(Math.ceil(smallNumber));` // prints 8\n\n- Rounding numbers down with `Math.floor()`\n  - `const num = 5.3456789;`\n  - `console.log(Math.floor(num));` // prints 5\n\n- Rounding numbers normally with `Math.round()`\n  - `const num = 5.3456789;`\n  - `console.log("Round: " + Math.round(num));`\n\n- Examples of rounding: \n  - `const num = 5.7456789;`\n  - `console.log("Ceil: " + Math.ceil(num));`\n  - `console.log("Floor: " + Math.floor(num));`\n  - `console.log("Round: " + Math.round(num));`\n\n- Getting MaximuZoom pm29and Minimum numbers with `Math.max()` and `Math.min()`\n  - `console.log("The max: " + Math.max(8, 2, -6));`\n  - `console.log("The min: " + Math.min(8, 2, -6));`\n\n- Getting random numbers with `Math.random()`\n  - Calling `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1\n  - `console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10));` // between 0 and 9\n  - `console.log(Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10));` // between 1 and 10',En=t(2),Rn=t(3);function Fn(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(En,{remarkPlugins:[Rn],children:Hn})})}var Hn='\n# PB - language - 5\n\nLast time\n  - Integers -- 5, 91, -56\n  - Floats ---- 3.14, 1.1235\n  - parseInt("61")\n  - parseFloat("7.61")\n  - Infinity\n  - NaN\n  - How to show a set number of decimals\n    - let num = 5.456789;\n    - num.toFixed(2);\n  - Mathematical function\n    - Math.ceil, Math.floor, Math.round\n    - Math.max(7,1,2,8);\n    - Math.min(7,1,2,8);\n    - Math.random() * 10;\n\n# Logical thinking\n\n- Logical operators\n  - AND `&&` - check if both are true\n  console.log(username === "Joel" && password === "12345");\n\n  - OR `||` - check if either is true\n  const username = "MrPotatohead";\n  const isAdmin = (username === "Joel") || (username === "Milad");\n  console.log("Administrator?

They are made up of expressions, keywords, operators and values. Generally Semicolons separate JavaScript statements, but are mostly optional.\n\nIn JavaScript we have expressions, which are bits of code that evaluate to a value, such as string, number or boolean.\n\nIn JavaScript the data handled by your code is stored in variables. Variables are declared by the `const`, `let` or `var` keyword. The `const` values are constant, not allowing a new value to be assigned to the variable after initialization. You must initialize a const variable with some value when you declare them. `let` variables allow reassignment and can be declared without assigning a value. `var` is similar to `let`, but should be avoided due to scoping issues.\n\nWe had a look at many operators, such as \n    - Arithmetic operators such as `- + * / %`- often used used for mathematical statements\n    - Assignment operators `= += -= *=` - often used to assign a value to a variable\n    - Boolean operators `&& ||` - often used to check things in conditionals    \n    - the Ternary operator `?`- often used to do one of two operations based on a boolean expression\n    \nJavaScript has a bunch of data types. We can check the type of a variable using `typeof`. We have mostly talked about the primitive data types Undefined, Boolean, Number and String. We have also talked about Functions and Arrays. Arrays are a special kind of Object - objects we will cover more in detail later.\n\nJavaScript keywords identify JavaScript actions to be performed. Keywords are for example `for, break, function, return, if`.\n\nJavaScript contains built in functionality for many common tasks, such as the Math built-in object for mathematical operations.\n\nWe run JavaScript with NodeJS (Node) using the `node` program. Node is usually good at reporting errors, giving us hints as to what went wrong and where.\n\nJS programs flow from top down; left to right. Code execution takes different paths depending on conditional statements, loops and function calls.\n\nConditional statements make the computer execute different bits of code based on a boolean condition. Loops can execute the same bit of code multiple times.\n\nJS programs often contain algorithms, and can even be thought of as algorithms. Algorithms are made of bits of code that solves a specific class of problems, such as calculating the average number or an array.\n\nJS programs often contain many blocks of code, often deeply nested; creating levels for variables to live in. When a variable is not scoped (contained) in any specific block, it is considered a global variable.\n\nFunctions are like mini programs in JavaScript. Many already exist and we can create many more. Functions that are associated with an Object or Class are called methods.\n\nFunctions that don\'t have any side affects are called pure functions. Side affects is anything in the function that reads, writes or accesses data outside of the arguments given to a function.\n\nA function can be called with zero, one or many arguments. The function definition defines parameters, which map the data provided to the function in arguments to variables (parameters) that can be accessed within the function.\n\nFunctions very often call other functions, so that there are multiple levels of functions being executed at any given time. This set of levels is called the `call stack`.\n\n## Solving code issues\n\nIf you can\'t seem to find where to start, start anywhere. Write out the concepts, write pseudocode. If you get stuck on a task, see the other tasks and remember to read all text.\n\nYour main tool, your text editor / VSCode helps us often, but cannot always be relied upon.MDN is a fantastic resource to use when facing specific technical questions.\nFor more general questions and help on algorithms, Google is your friend.\n    - "javascript reverse array"\n    - "javascript lowercase first letter"\n    - "javascript how can I calculate average\n    \nAlso, for many programming questions, the site StackOverflow is very useful if you are stuck on something alone and cannot solve it. Take care when writing questions; really think about what and how you are asking and when you give code examples, make sure your code is formatted well.\n\n## Longer coding example\n// TASK: calculates the average length of words in the given languages:\nconst sentences = [\n    "en I like cats and dogs",\n    "de Ich liebe Katzen und Hunde",\n    "es Me gustan los gatos y los perros",\n    "fr J\'adore les chats et les chiens",\n    "se Jag tykcer on katten och huden",\n    "fi Min\xe4 pid\xe4n kirista ja kissoista", \n    "jp Boku wa neko ni mo inu ni mo daisuki des", \n    "he Ani oeve hatulim ve klavim",\n];\nfor (let i = 0; i < sentences.length; i++) {\n    const sentence = sentences[i];\n    const words = sentence.split(" ");    \n    \n    let sumOfWordLengths = 0;\n    for (let j = 1; j < words.length; j++) {\n        const word = words[j];\n        sumOfWordLengths += word.length;\n    }    \n    \n    console.log(`${words[0]} ----\x3e ${Math.round(sumOfWordLengths / (words.length - 1))}`);\n}',xt=t(2),yt=t(3);function wt(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(xt,{remarkPlugins:[yt],children:Ot})})}var Ot='\n# PB - Data Structure - 1\n\nYesterday we did\n    - Review\n    - Test\n\nToday we will\n    - Start to learn about objects\n\n# Introduction\n\nData structures? More advanced ways of storing data. Data organization, management and storage format\nthat enables efficient access and modification. Arrays are data structures.\n\nData is stored in the working memory (RAM) of your computer; not in the persistent (hard drive) memory. \n\nAll variables are stored in the RAM, some programs take up a lot of memory.\n\n# Objects\n\nI *highly* suggest that you code along with me as I show examples.\n\n- like a basket for holding many related variables together inside\n    - in objects, data is stored as key-value pairs\n- objects can be thought of as a `namespace`; they allow you to store variables like "username" without getting naming conflicts. Not a super important term :)\n\n- often objects represent one concept, like a user or blog post\n- it\'s common to have an array of objects; like an array of users\n\n# Object literals\n\n- Remember Array literals?\n    - INTRODUCING Object literals!\n        - `const <nameOfObject> = { <key1>:<value1>, <key2>:<value2> };`\n        - the values can be any kind of value in JS\n\n- Keys / Variables inside objects, for example the `age` there, are called properties!\n- The last property in the list may end with a comma\n    - called a "TRAILING" or "HANGING" comma\n    - trailing commas make it easier to add/remove/move properties\n\n# Const or let?\n\n- When you create a `const` object variable, you can edit the stored object (its properties), but you cannot reassign the variable. The same is true for arrays. For const arrays we can edit the contents of the array, but we can not reassign them.\n\n        +-----------------+-------+------------------------+\n        | VARIABLE        | VALUE | MEMORY                 |\n        +-----------------+-------+------------------------+\n        | const myName    | Joel  |                        |\n        +-----------------+-------+------------------------+\n        | const myAge     | 94    |                        |\n        +-----------------+-------+------------------------+\n        | const petsArray | 0x001 | ["Veera", "Rauli"]     |\n        +-----------------+-------+------------------------+\n        | const userObj   | 0x002 | { name: "John Smith" } |\n        +-----------------+-------+------------------------+\n\n\n- Objects can contain arrays, and arrays can contain objects!\n\n- Accessing properties\n    - Get Values\n        - // bracket notation, like arrays\n        - console.log(product["description"]);\n        - // dot notation\n        - console.log(product.description);\n    - Set Values\n        - Bracket notation\n        - `product["price"] = 4;`\n        - Dot notation\n        - `product.description_id = "Test"`\n\n# The Type\n\n- The type - objects are objects\n    - Arrays are specific kinds of objects\n    - typeof {}\n    - typeof [1,2,3]\n    - To check if something is an array\n        - `Array.isArray()`\n        - console.log(Array.isArray({})); // false\n        - console.log(Array.isArray([1,2,3])); // true\n\n- Objects (and arrays), even empty ones, are truthy\n`console.log("Object truthy? ", Boolean({})); // true`\n`console.log("Object truthy? ", Boolean([])); // true`\n\n# Delete and add properties\n\n- You can completely remove properties using `delete`\n    - Remove the strength propety:\n    - `delete searchResult.strength;` \n\n- You can add new properties using the bracket or the dot notation\n    - puppy.color = "black";\n    - puppy["breed"] = "mixed";\n\n# COMPUTED PROPERTIES\n\n- We can use brackets in an object literal\n    - (that\'s called computed properties)\n    - With brackets, we can use a variable for the name of a property\n\n            const identifier = "_id";\n            const goat = {\n                name: "Mary",\n                [identifier]: 1234,\n            };\n            console.log(goat);\n\n# Tips and tricks\n\n- Note: Keywords / Reserved words in JS are allowed as property names\n\n        const anotherGoat = {\n        default: true,\n        function: 1234,\n        delete: "YEAH SOMETHING HERE"\n        };\n        console.log(anotherGoat);\n\n\n- "Property value shorthand"\n    - In the real world, it\'s very common to use variables to set object properties.\n    - When the property and the variable have the same name, we can shorten this!\n\n        const username = "Req";\n        const age = 11;\n\n        const user = {\n            username, // property value shorthand\n            age,  // property value shorthand\n        };\n\n\n',vt=t(2),kt=t(3);function St(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(vt,{remarkPlugins:[kt],children:Tt})})}var Tt='\n# PB - Data Structure - 2\n\nYesterday we did\n    - Object literals { age: 77 }\n    - Computed Properties { [propertyName]: "Admin" }\n    - Property value shorthand { username }\n    - Array and Object Typing\n        - typeof {} --\x3e "object"\n        - Array.isArray(someVariable)\n\nToday we will do\n    - Methods\n    - Object scope / object context\n\n> Reminder: Tools to help you review / learn\n> Edabit - for more problems to solve\n> freecodecamp.org - to practice syntax\n> Codewars (Thanks Lars!)\n\n# Before the lectures, a look at the previous task\n\nNow try to do it again :)\n\n# Methods\n\nWhat be a method?\n- "Methods are functions associated with an object (or class)"\n- "Methods are properties with function values"\n\nFor example - both of these functions are methods\n    - `Math.random()` - "random" is a funtion, "Math" is a built-in object in JS that someone else has made for us\n    - `Math.ceil(1.2345)` - "ceil" is a function, also associated with the "Math" object.\n\nCreating methods is really similar to creating normal functions\n\n# Object literal context\n\nMethods have one advantage over functions: they can refer to their associated object.\n\nIn a function definition, `this` refers to the "owner" of the function. In our `animal` example, the animal object owns the `charge` function. \n\nIn other words, `this.type` means the `type` property of the `animal` object.\n\nIn a function, the `this` keyword refers to the context ("the owner") in which the function is running.\n\n# Important note\n\nDue to the way that JavaScript functions work, you cannot use arrow functions for methods where you use the `this` keyword. \n\nWhen you take a method out of the object, it gets "unbound" from the original parent object.\n\nBinding = connecting = attaching a function to an object, without editing the original object.\n\n# Ultra quick simple new technique time\n\nThe "for...in" loop\n    - Useful for example when you don\'t know what properties an object has\n    - Useful for comparing objects\n\nNote: When comparing two objects, `object1 === object2` will always be false\n\n\n# Object Literal Method Shorthand\n\nA shorter way of writing methods in object literals :)\n\n# Reminder: Tools to help you review / learn\n\n> Edabit - for more problems to solve\n> freecodecamp.org - to practice syntax\n> Codewars (Thanks Lars!)',Ct=t(2),Bt=t(3);function It(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(Ct,{remarkPlugins:[Bt],children:At})})}var At='\n# PB - Data Structures - 3\n\nLast time we did\n    - Methods\n    - Object scope / object context: `this`\n    - the for...in loop\n\nToday we will do\n    - Yet Another For Loop!\n    - Object helper methods\n\nLater this week we will do\n    - Clone vs Reference\n    - Destructuring\n    - Nesting\n    - Advanced array methods\n\n\n# Quiz\n\n    WELL DONE EVERYONE!\n\n# New things\n\nRemember the `for...in` loop?

This is sometimes called "pass by value"\n\nObjects (and arrays) are not copied or cloned to function; a reference to them is given instead. This is sometimes called "pass by reference".\n\n# Hoooow can we clone an object then?!?\n\nCloning is hard.\n\nTrying to clone an object with the `=` assignment operator doesn\'t necessarily work the way you expect, because objects are references.\n\nThe spread operator (technically called the spread syntax) `...` is a convenient way to make a *shallow* copy of an array or object. Shallow - meaning that there is no nested arrays or objects. Shallow = not deeply nested. \n\nThe spread syntax "spreads" the array values or object properties where it is used.\n\n# Deep cloning technique\n\nYou can clone simple nested objects and arrays using a technique that uses `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`. We will discuss both of them later, this is just one technique that uses them. This does not work for some fancier data / situations, but for most things this is fine. There are many other techniques online if you need them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',Nt=t(2),Ut=t(3);function Et(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(Nt,{remarkPlugins:[Ut],children:Rt})})}var Rt='\n# PB - Data Structure - 5\n\nYesterday we did\n    Clone vs. Reference\n    Spread syntax\n\nToday we will do\n    Destructuring\n    Nesting\n\n# Destructuring\n\nNew and cool!\n\nThe two most common data structures in JS are Object and Array. When we pass data to a function, it may not accept an object or an array as a whole, but rather individual pieces.\n\n`Destructuring assignment` is a special syntax that allows us to "unpack" arrays / objects into separate variables. Sometimes this is more convenient. Destructuring also works great with complex functions that have a lot of parameters, default values and so on.\n\nIt\'s called "destructuing assignment" because it "destructures" by copying items into variables. The original array / object is not modified!\n\n## Examples!\n\n1. Destructuring arrays part 1\n2. Destructuring arrays part 2\n3. Destructuring arrays part 3\n4. Destructuring strings\n5.

Usually what is actually done is some kind of combination of these (and/or _functional programming_).\n\nIn some languages (Java, C#), almost everything is done with classes and objects; single functions don\'t really exist.\n\nIn OOP, you divide your code into separate, independent parts that take care of one concept in your code. These parts are your Classes. They can be equivalent to a real world thing, such as a "Product" or a "User" - or they can be a functional component of your program, such as "Logger" or "Database".\n\nThese different concepts that you have (User, Product) *encapsulate* the data related to a user or a product and also the functionality that they need. That is the theory. In the real world, especially in JS, this is not always the whole story. During learning the basics, we will focus on objects like User, Product or Book, because they are easy to understand.\n\nWe have already partly done this by using object literals.\n\nWhen your data and functionality is encapsulated within one concept, you can simply access the surface (interface) of that functionality, and not really care about how it works under the surface. In other words, some of the complexity is hidden - this is called *abstraction*.\n\nAlso, because the details are abstracted away, if the way we calculate salaries changes, most likely we just have to change one place (the inside of this function), not every place it is called.\n\nTo create these users or employees, we need a nice way to create lots of (almost) identical objects. This is done with Classes. Before we look into *actual* classes, let\'s look behind the scenes a bit.\n\n# Constructor functions\n\nThe object literal `{ name: "Jo" }` allows to create objects. Often we need to create many similar objects, like multiple users or menu items and so on. That can be done using *constructor functions* and the *new* operator.\n\nConstructor functions technically are regular functions. There are two conventions to follow: \n\n1. They are named with the first letter capitalized.\n2. They should be executed only with `new` operator.\n\n# EXAMPLE 1\n\nHere in example 1, it\'s the `new` operator that is doing the magic. First, we define a User and then we create a new user based on that definition. This is called *instantiation* and the objects created are called *instances* as in "jack is an instance of User".\n\nWhen a function is executed with `new`, behind the scenes it does the following steps:\n    1. A new empty object is created and assigned to `this`.\n    2. The function body executes. \n        Usually it modifies `this`, such as adding new properties to it.\n    3. The value of `this` is returned.\n\n    function User(name) {\n        // this = {};  (implicitly)\n\n        this.name = name;\n        this.isAdmin = false;\n\n        // return this;  (implicitly)\n    }\n\n# EXAMPLE 2\n\nSo `const rauli = new Pet("Rauli", "cat", 9)` gives a similar, but not the same result as:\n\n    const rauli = {\n        name: "Rauli",\n        type: "cat",\n        age: 9,\n    };\n\nNow if we want to create pets, we can just call new Pet(...) \n    - Shorter than using object literals\n    - Easy to read\n    - Makes consistent data - every pet WILL have a type\n    - Gives pretty nice console.logs\n\nThat\u2019s the purpose of constructors: to implement reusable object creation\n\n\n# EXAMPLE 3\n\nThis prevents misuse as technically, any regular function can be used as a constructor, as in any function can be run with `new` to run it as defined above. Even if they are not designed for that. Arrow functions specifically block that chance.\n\nThe "first letter capitalized" is a common agreement, to make it clear that a function is intended to be run with new.\n\n# EXAMPLE 4\n\nReturn from constructors? Constructors should not have a return statement. Their task is to write all necessary stuff into *this*, and *this* automatically becomes the thing that is returned.\n\nIf there is a return statement, then the rules are simple:\n    1. If `return` is used without anything, the *this* is returned.\n    2. If an object is returned, it\'s not really a constructor, just a function that returns an object.\n    3. If return is called with a primitive, it\u2019s ignored.\n\n    Someone tell me the primitives of javascript pls. Use google if you don\'t know.\n\n        - number, string, booleans\n\nTo put it simply: avoid using `return` in constructor functions.\n\n# EXAMPLE 5 - prototypes\n\nIf you want to learn more, self study.\n\nWe can edit constructor functions after creating them by accessing their "prototype" object.\n\nYou don\'t generally do this, so this is just an example.\n\n',$t=t(2),qt=t(3);function Kt(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)($t,{remarkPlugins:[qt],children:Xt})})}var Xt='\n# PB - Classes - 2\n\nLast time we did\n    constructor functions\n    a bit on prototype\n\nToday we will do\n    actual classes\n\n# Actual classes\n\nI think these are much nicer to read then constructor functions. Classes define a single concept, such as Product, User, MenuItem, Page or a Button.\n\n## EXAMPLE 1\n\nThe basic Class syntax in JavaScript\n\nTo use classes in JavaScript we need two new things. First, we need the `class` keyword and second we need a `constructor` - constructor is just a special function name. \n\nThen, we can again use the `new` keyword to create a new object based on this class. his, again, is called instantiation. With the `new` keyword we are creating a new instance of a Class.\n\n*THEORY*\nClasses in JavaScript are actually just "syntactic sugar" over the things we already know. \n\n> "Syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to write. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer."\n> - Wikipedia\n\nWhen you write a class, "under the hood" it gets converted into a constructor function and prototype things.\n\n    What the `class Pet {...}` syntactic sugar really does is:\n        1. Creates a function named Pet\n        2. That function becomes the result of the class declaration.\n        3. The function code is taken from the constructor method (empty if we don\u2019t make a constructor).\n        4. Stores methods in `Pet.prototype.`\n\n## EXAMPLE 2\n\nDefinition: A class is a blueprint or prototype that defines the variables and methods common to all objects of a certain kind. \n\nIt is common for classes to have multiple methods, not just the constructor.\n\n## EXAMPLE 3\n\nClasses are functions?!? \n\nUsually you can ignore this!\n\n## EXAMPLE 4\n\nClass Expressions\n\n## EXAMPLE 5\n\nStatic methods - these are functions that we call directly on the class, not its instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc2d \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58',_t=t(2),Qt=t(3);function Zt(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(_t,{remarkPlugins:[Qt],children:eo})})}var eo='\n# PB - Classes - 3\n\nYesterday we did\n    actual classes\n\nToday we will do\n    - properties, static properties\n    - The `Date` class\n\n# Quiz\n\n# Class properties and static properties\n\nClasses can have properties, kind of like objects can. In JS, these things are called "Class fields". Quite often these are just referred to as properties. This is a very new feature in JavaScript!\n\n## EXAMPLE 1\n\nClass fields are set on individual objects\n\n## EXAMPLE 2\n\nClass fields can be static too!\nStatic properties exist on the class, not the instances.\n\n## EXAMPLE 3\n\nClass fields are public by default, but they can be private too. NOT super important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The Date class\n\nThis is the basic way of working with time stuff in JS. For instance, we can use it to store creation/modification times, to measure time, or just to print out the current date.\n\n> A JavaScript date is internally specified as the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since midnight on January 1, 1970, UTC. This date and time are not the same as the UNIX epoch (the number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight on January 1, 1970, UTC), which is the predominant base value for computer-recorded date and time values. - Wikipedia\n\nDates and times are very complicated to handle and the Dates in JavaScript are famous for being annoying. Very commonly big projects use external time libraries.\n\n## EXAMPLES',no=t(2),to=t(3);function oo(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{id:"content",children:Object(d.jsx)(no,{remarkPlugins:[to],children:io})})}var io='\n# PB - Classes - 4\n\nLast time we did\n    properties, static properties\n    the `Date` class\n\nToday we will do\n    Nodemon\n    Inheritance\n\nNext monday (24.05) and tuesday (25.05) are days off, so no classes then!\n\n# Nodemon\n\nNodemon "Node monitor" is a tool commonly used when developing with Node. Nodemin is a utility that watches files and as soon as it notices a change in a file, it will restart your program.\n\nTo close nodemon you need to press `Ctrl+c`\n\nInstall nodemon `npm install -g nodemon`. This install nodemon Globally (the -g flag) meaning that you can use it from anywhere.\n\n# Inheritance\n\nClasses in JavaScript support inheritance using the `extends` keyword. For example in\n\n    class Parent { }\n    class Child extends Parent { } \n\nthe Child class inherits from Parent: the constructor, fields, and methods. In cases like this, the Parent class is sometimes called the base class and sometimes even the super class.\n\n# EXAMPLE 1 - Basic constructors\n\n# EXAMPLE 2 - Parent and Child constructors\n\n# EXAMPLE 3 - More complex use case\n';var so=function(){return Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"wrapper",children:[Object(d.jsx)(h,{}),Object(d.jsxs)("button",{type:"button",id:"sidebarCollapse",className:"navbar-btn",children:[Object(d.jsx)("span",{}),Object(d.jsx)("span",{}),Object(d.jsx)("span",{})]}),Object(d.jsxs)(l.c,{children:[Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{exact:!0,path:"/",children:Object(d.jsx)(j,{})}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/BDL01",component:f}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/BDL02",component:x}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/BDL03",component:y}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/BDL04",component:w}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/BDL05",component:O}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/BDL06",component:v}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/BDL07",component:k}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/BDL08",component:S}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/BDL09",component:T}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB10",component:C}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB11",component:A}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB12",component:D}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB13",component:R}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB14",component:J}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB15",component:V}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB16",component:X}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB17",component:ee}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB18",component:ie}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB19",component:le}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB20",component:ue}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB21",component:ge}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB22",component:ye}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB23",component:ke}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB24",component:Be}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB25",component:Me}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB26",component:Ue}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB27",component:He}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB28",component:Ge}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB29",component:qe}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB30",component:Qe}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB31",component:tn}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB32",component:rn}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB33",component:hn}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB34",component:bn}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/UIB35",component:xn}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB36",component:vn}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB37",component:Cn}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB38",component:Pn}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB39",component:Nn}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB40",component:Fn}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB41",component:zn}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB42",component:$n}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB43",component:_n}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB44",component:nt}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB45",component:st}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB46",component:ct}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB47",component:mt}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB48",component:jt}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB49",component:wt}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB50",component:St}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB51",component:It}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB52",component:Lt}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB53",component:Et}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB54",component:Wt}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB55",component:Yt}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB56",component:Kt}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB57",component:Zt}),Object(d.jsx)(l.a,{path:"/PB58",component:oo})]})]})};r.a.render(Object(d.jsx)(i.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(d.jsx)(s.a,{children:Object(d.jsx)(so,{})})}),document.getElementById("root"))},86:function(e,n,t){}},[[225,1,2]]]);
