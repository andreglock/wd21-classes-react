# SPA - DOM - 4

Yesterday we did
    - Introduction to events
    - Keyboard, mouse and browser events

    ```js
    const butt = document.querySelector("button");
    butt.addEventListener("click", (e) => { ... });
    butt.addEventListener("mouseenter", (e) => { ... });
    butt.addEventListener("mouseleave", (e) => { ... });

    const input = document.querySelector("#email");
    input.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => { ... });

    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", (e) => {
        ...
    })
    ```

# Review Quote of the Day

Today we will do
    - The event object and form events
    - Event propagation / delegation

# The Event Object

- Remember when we used the (e) parameter and e.keyCode in the kebyoard event listener?
- That's the event object
- Each event is represented by an object that is based on the Event interface
    - This means all events have a certain common set of functions and properties
    - Different events can also have custom properties
        - depending on the type of event
    - Some events happen on the window (resizing for example)
    - Some events happen on elements (click for example)

## Form events as an example, focusing on the event object

# Propagation, Delegation

## Event bubbling and propagation

> "Events bubble from innermost to outermost elements" - Someone somewhere
> Or they bubble up the DOM tree

- Propagation == What kind of stuff happens when an event happens

https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/images/eventflow.svg

- normally the event listeners we are defining work during the "bubble" phase

- A common problem with bubbling is if we don't want the event to go to the parents
    - use `Event.stopPropagation()`

- Less commonly, we can also force the event listeners to work in the capture phase too
    - use a third argument `useCapture`

## Event delegation; Different Event Targets

> Event delegation promotes binding as few DOM event handlers as possible, since each event handler requires memory. For example, letâ€™s say that we have an HTML unordered list we want to bind event handlers to. Instead of binding a click event handler for each list item (which may be hundreds for all we know), we bind one click handler to the parent unordered list itself.

### To do that, we need to look at two event properties

- `Event.target` vs. `Event.currentTarget`
    - target is the element that triggered the event (e.g., the user clicked on)
    - currentTarget is the element that the event listener is attached to.

- When we add elements dynamically after the page is loaded, we need to then again create new event handlers for them unless we delegate.
- Bad performance especially for long and changing lists
