# UIB - UIUX - Design

## Basic principles of UI design

- Structure (Overall UI architecture)
        - Organize the UI meaningully and usefully
        - Use clear & consistent models that are recognizable
        - Put related things together, separate unrelated things
                - Company metadata section
                        - About us, Jobs, Media, History, Campuses
                - Products section
                        - Search, Promotions, Lookbooks, etc..
        - Differentiate dissimilar things, make similar things resemble each other
- Simplicity
        - Design should make simple, common tasks easy
        - Communicate clearly and simply in the users own language
        - Provide good shortcuts that are meaningully related to longer procedures
- Visibility
        - Make all needed options and materials visible
        - Don't distract the user with extra or redundant information
        - Don't overwhelm the user with alternatives or confuse with unneeded information
- Feedback
        - Keep the user informed of
                - Actions or interpretations
                - Changes of state
                - Errors or exceptions that are relevat to the user
        - Feedback should clear, concise and unambiguous (an in a language familiar to the user)
- Tolerance
        - Design should be flexible and tolerant
        - Reduce the cost of mistakes and misuse by allowing undo / redo
        - Prevent errors when possible by tolerating varied inputs and sequences
        - Interpret all reasonable actions
- Reuse
        - The design should reuse internal and external componets and behaviours
        - Maintain consistency with purpose rather than arbitrary consistency
        - Reduce teh need for users to rethink and remember

- Additionally, focus on design consistency and components
        - Elements look the same everywhere
        - Space between elements is consistent
        - Buttons look similar etc

## Designing with Colors!

- Branding is important here!
        - Tiffany.de -- The "Tiffany" blue
        - Fiskars.com -- The "Fiskars" orange
        - Fazer.com -- The "Fazer" blue
- You often have one primary or main color
        - That doesn't mean to make _everything_ that color
        - Primary color does not mean background color
        - You can have a dark AND a light version using the same color palette!
        - "A tamer primary color and a brighter accent color gives apps a bold, colorful look without overwhelming the content"
- In addition to the primary color, you'll most likely have a set of others too!
        - Secondary or Accent color
        - Plus others, I'd advise to have at least three colors
        - Accent colors, like the The "Fiskars" orange *could* be used in
                - Buttons
                - Hover action hilights
                - Controls (sliders, switches, inputs...)
                - Hilighted text, Progress bars
                - Links and Headlines
- Selecting colors
        - It's easiet to start with one main color / starting point
        - It's easiest and simplest to use a generator

                - *Self study hint* https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-and-palettes

- Design guidelines document example
        - Color palette
        - Content examples
        - Component examples
        - A mature version of of this would be Material UI

## More on color!
        
- Hue
        - Color in its pure form
- Saturation
        - The intensity or purity of a hue -- vivid, bright
        - A very saturated website: neopets.com
- Lightness - the relative degree of black / white mixed with a give hue
        - A lot of black - a duller color
- Tempretarure
        - To make a color warmer, add orange or yellow
        - To make a color colder, add blue

*notes on color*
- Color meaning might vary from culture to culture
- Accessibility is relevant when choosing a color palette
- When learning, it's a good idea try to implement nice looking designs from other websites
- Experiment with textures too!

## An example on color usage - light and shadows

- Shadows convey elevation
- You can use text and box shadows to emulate a light source

        - Syntax is a fantastic podcast generally, but the other topics are a bit more advanced usually
- https://mockplus.com/blog/post/learn-ui-design (quick read, has good links to resources)
- https://whydoweinterface.com/ (longer read, like a book with for example historical info rather than a tutorial, also a great looking website!)
