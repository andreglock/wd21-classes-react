# PB - Classes - 4

Last time we did
    properties, static properties
    the `Date` class

Today we will do
    Nodemon
    Inheritance

Next monday (24.05) and tuesday (25.05) are days off, so no classes then!

# Nodemon

Nodemon "Node monitor" is a tool commonly used when developing with Node. Nodemin is a utility that watches files and as soon as it notices a change in a file, it will restart your program.

To close nodemon you need to press `Ctrl+c`

Install nodemon `npm install -g nodemon`. This install nodemon Globally (the -g flag) meaning that you can use it from anywhere.

# Inheritance

Classes in JavaScript support inheritance using the `extends` keyword. For example in

    class Parent { }
    class Child extends Parent { } 

the Child class inherits from Parent: the constructor, fields, and methods. In cases like this, the Parent class is sometimes called the base class and sometimes even the super class.

# EXAMPLE 1 - Basic constructors

# EXAMPLE 2 - Parent and Child constructors

# EXAMPLE 3 - More complex use case
