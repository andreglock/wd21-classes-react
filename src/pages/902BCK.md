# Backend - Server - 3

# The journey so far

- So we made a few servers using the NodeJS http module
    - It works, but it sucks
- Most Node servers don't use http, it gets very messy
- One super popular framework that can help us is `Express`

# Introducing Express

- `Express` is a framework
    - It gives you an API, methodology and conventions
    - It understands the web I think better more than the basic http does
        - static asset hosting
        - template systems
        - cookies
        - better data parsing
        - and much more
