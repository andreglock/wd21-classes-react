# BDL 8 - Even MORE git stuff!

- `git init` - initializes the current working folder as a git repository
- Init should just be run one time per repository
- `git` commands can be run in subfolders
- Git _only_ tracks files, not directories
- The commit message of the first commit to a repo often is "Initial import", "Initial commit" or something similar
- You can create a repository in GitHub before OR after creating your local project
- To add an existing local git repository (new project for example) to a newly created GH repository, you need to add the GH repository as a _remote_
    - `git remote add origin https://github.com/usernamehere/projectnamehere.git`
- You can see the manual for git commands too! `man git branch`

git config --global init.defaultBranch main
